# Sorting Algorithms Comparison ðŸ”¬
This repository compares several sorting algorithms implemented in Java 11. As of now following algorithms are implemented:
- Bubblesort
- Insertionsort

## Getting Started ðŸš€
1. Open a terminal and clone the repository
2. Switch into the _sorting-algorithms-comparison_ directory
3. Run `gradlew run` to see the results

## Contributing ðŸ˜„
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a new class in the `algorithms` package
3. Implement the `SortingAlgorithm` interface
4. Write your algorithm in the `sort` method
5. Run `gradlew run` and your algorithm will automatically be executed
6. Add a test for your algorithm to guarantee your implementation is working 
6. Commit your work and submit a pull request
